            <h3>Preservation through institutionalization</h3>
            <p>
              Both historically and culturally, Bastar holds a significant
              position in place. It is a land of tribal art, dialects, music and
              culture. However, folk art, languages and dance forms are fast
              going extinct.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Of 36 dialects, only 5 have survived. Folk dances like Dandari,
              Mandari, Kakasad and musical instruments like tudbudi, nishan,
              mohri have been lost to modern times.
            </h4>

            <p>
              Further, the area where BADAL is now situated was inaccessible due
              to the perception of threat to safety due to Naxalism. This
              compound was a motel in older times that was in a state of
              dilapidation. It had also become a hub for anti-social elements.
              BADAL transformed this area and breathed new life into it by
              turning it into an opportunity for boosting livelihoods and the
              economy both in line with tribal welfare and development.
